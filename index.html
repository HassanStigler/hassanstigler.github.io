<h1>Hassan Stigler</h1>
<div class="tagline">Senior Product Leader — SaaS, Platform & FinTech</div>

<p>
I lead enterprise SaaS and FinTech platforms through growth, modernization, and scale.
Over the last five years, I owned platform strategy, API programs, and product modernization
for GoFileRoom — a $40M+ document management platform inside Thomson Reuters.
</p>

<p>
My work sits at the intersection of customer trust, technical platforms, and revenue growth.
</p>

<h2>Career Impact</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span class="metric">$38M → $43M</span> in platform revenue under my product leadership</li>
  <li><span class="metric">–15 → +3</span> pNPS turnaround by restoring customer confidence</li>
  <li><span class="metric">3 FTE equivalent</span> saved for customers through platform automation</li>
  <li>SOC 2 readiness, CIAM migration, and service reliability modernization</li>
  <li>Built API programs, developer portals, telemetry, and escalation models</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Business Reality of GoFileRoom</h2>
<p>
GoFileRoom was never a weak product.
</p>

<p>
When I took ownership, it was already generating about $38M annually with very little investment from the company.
Customers trusted the platform to hold their most critical documents — but they did not trust that their needs were being heard
or that the product would continue to evolve.
</p>

<p>
Internally, some believed the product had no long-term future because it lacked modernization, integrations,
and a clear roadmap. Externally, customers were loyal — but increasingly frustrated by slow change, limited integrations,
and poor visibility into issues.
</p>

<p>
My job was not to “save” GoFileRoom. It was to turn a trusted but under-invested product into a platform
the company could confidently invest in.
</p>

<h2>What Changed Under My Leadership</h2>
<p>
I ran GoFileRoom as a business-critical platform, not just a backlog.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Created a platform roadmap tied directly to revenue and retention</li>
  <li>Built telemetry and dashboards to expose outages, risk, and adoption in real time</li>
  <li>Established escalation paths so enterprise customers were no longer left in the dark</li>
  <li>Worked directly with power users to validate priorities and rebuild confidence</li>
</ul>

<p>
These changes made GoFileRoom investable again — and the revenue followed.
</p>

<h2>The API & Platform Program</h2>
<p>
APIs were not a side project. They were a strategic unlock.
</p>

<p>
We built APIs that allowed customers to automate document workflows, integrate GoFileRoom
into tax and accounting ecosystems, and replace manual work that previously required multiple staff members.
</p>

<p>
We also built APIs for internal teams who relied on GoFileRoom for their own customer-facing products,
eliminating blockers and turning disconnected systems into a shared platform.
</p>

<p>
I owned the API roadmap, platform priorities, developer experience, and governance —
while engineering built the services.
</p>

<p>
One enterprise customer told us that our APIs replaced the work of three full-time staff members.
</p>

<h2>How I Led</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Led SOC 2 readiness and security modernization in 2025</li>
  <li>Owned CIAM migration with minimal customer disruption</li>
  <li>Managed and mentored two development analysts and junior PMs</li>
  <li>Delivered features end-to-end, including webhook-driven workflows</li>
  <li>Reduced support delays through telemetry, dashboards, and escalation paths</li>
  <li>Built direct relationships with enterprise customers to drive adoption and pNPS</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>
GoFileRoom went from a quietly profitable but under-invested product to a platform the company actively funds,
grows, and believes in.
</p>

<p>
Revenue grew from $38M to over $43M. Customer trust rebounded. And the product now has a clear future.
</p>

<h2>What I Do Now</h2>
<p>
I help SaaS and FinTech organizations turn trusted but under-optimized products into modern,
scalable, revenue-driving platforms.
</p>

<p>
APIs, data platforms, and developer ecosystems are part of how I do that — not the only thing I do.
