  <h1>Hassan Stigler</h1>
  <div class="tagline">
    Senior Product Manager • Platform & API Strategy • FinTech
  </div>

  <p>
    I lead complex platform products that sit at the intersection of APIs, data, and revenue.
    Over the last five years I have owned API strategy, developer experience, and platform modernization
    for a $40M+ FinTech product at Thomson Reuters.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work combines technical execution with commercial outcomes — driving adoption, improving reliability,
    and turning stagnant products into revenue-growing platforms.
  </p>

  <h2>Career Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="metric">$38M → $43M</span> in platform revenue under my product leadership</li>
    <li><span class="metric">–15 → +3</span> pNPS turnaround through customer trust and platform reliability</li>
    <li><span class="metric">3 FTE equivalent</span> saved for customers through API enablement</li>
    <li>Built developer portals, API catalogs, roadmaps, and escalation models</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Flagship Case Study — GoFileRoom Platform</h2>
  <p>
    GoFileRoom is a tax & accounting platform used by enterprise firms.
    When I took ownership, the product was viewed internally and externally as stagnant,
    unreliable, and difficult to integrate.
  </p>

  <p>
    I led the transformation into a modern platform with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Public APIs with full documentation, summaries, and use-case driven endpoints</li>
    <li>Developer portal migration and API catalog strategy</li>
    <li>Support telemetry, service dashboards, and escalation paths</li>
    <li>Direct relationships with power users and enterprise customers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Customers told us that being able to use these APIs replaced the work of multiple staff members —
    and that shift directly supported platform adoption and renewal growth.
  </p>

  <h2>API & Platform Work</h2>
  <p>
    I am not a career developer — I am a product leader who works fluently in API ecosystems.
    I have spent 5–6 years defining, launching, and evolving REST and SOAP APIs,
    managing versioning, endpoint design, developer experience, and platform governance.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>API lifecycle management from roadmap → design → release → adoption</li>
    <li>Collections, endpoint taxonomy, and developer usability</li>
    <li>Platform telemetry and operational readiness</li>
    <li>Commercial alignment between API usage and revenue</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I Do Now</h2>
  <p>
    I specialize in senior-level platform and API product leadership roles in FinTech and SaaS —
    helping organizations turn technical assets into scalable, revenue-driving platforms.
