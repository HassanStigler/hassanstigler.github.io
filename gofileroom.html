<h1>GoFileRoom Platform Turnaround</h1>

<p>
  GoFileRoom is a tax and accounting platform serving enterprise firms across the United States.
  When I took ownership of the product, it was generating roughly $40M in annual revenue with very little ongoing investment.
  Customers trusted it to run their firms — but they did not trust that the product had a future.
</p>

<h2>The Situation</h2>
<p>
  Firms depended on GoFileRoom for mission-critical document workflows, yet lacked confidence that their needs
  were being heard or that meaningful improvements were coming.
  Integration, automation, and operational visibility lagged behind customer expectations.
</p>

<p>
  Internally, this created strategic risk. Despite strong revenue and deep customer trust,
  some believed the product would not survive the next three years without modernization
  and a clear platform vision.
</p>

<p>
  The gap wasn’t value — it was leadership, visibility, and a credible roadmap for the future.
</p>

<h2>My Mandate</h2>
<p>
  I was brought in to give GoFileRoom a real product future:
  restore customer confidence, modernize the platform, and create a foundation leadership
  could confidently invest in.
</p>

<h2>What I Led</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Created a platform roadmap aligned to revenue, retention, and customer trust</li>
  <li>Built public APIs and webhook-based workflows to enable automation and integration</li>
  <li>Led CIAM migration to a new identity platform</li>
  <li>Drove SOC 2 readiness and security modernization in 2025</li>
  <li>Built telemetry, dashboards, and escalation paths for operational visibility</li>
  <li>Managed and aligned development analysts and engineering execution to product priorities</li>
  <li>Built direct relationships with enterprise power users to shape roadmap decisions</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Changed</h2>
<ul>
  <li><span class="metric">$38M → $43M</span> in platform revenue</li>
  <li><span class="metric">–15 → +3</span> pNPS turnaround</li>
  <li>Support teams gained visibility and faster response times</li>
  <li>Customers adopted APIs to replace manual staff workflows</li>
  <li>Leadership regained confidence in the product’s future</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Leadership Invested</h2>
<p>
  By restoring customer trust, delivering real platform improvements, and creating transparency
  through telemetry and roadmaps, GoFileRoom shifted from a profitable but neglected system
  into a modern, investable platform.
</p>

<p>
  Leadership didn’t reinvest because revenue was collapsing —
  they reinvested because the product finally had a credible future.
</p>

<h2>Why It Worked</h2>
<p>
  This wasn’t a single project or an API release.
  It was an operating-model change.
</p>

<p>
  Product, engineering, security, support, and customers were aligned around a simple truth:
  trust comes from reliability, visibility, and the ability to integrate.
</p>

<p>
  APIs, dashboards, identity, and customer relationships were the levers that made that possible.
