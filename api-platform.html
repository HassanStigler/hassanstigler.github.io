<h1>API & Platform Leadership</h1>
<div class="tagline">How I turned GoFileRoom into an extensible, revenue-driving platform</div>

<p>
At Thomson Reuters, APIs were not a technical side project — they were a strategic product lever.
I owned the API and platform strategy for GoFileRoom, a $40M+ enterprise document management platform
serving tax and accounting firms across North America.
</p>

<p>
The engineering teams built the services.  
I owned the platform vision, roadmap, governance, and commercial outcomes.
</p>

<h2>Why the API Program Existed</h2>
<p>
GoFileRoom was deeply trusted by customers, but it was locked behind a web UI.
That limited automation, slowed firms down, and prevented GoFileRoom from becoming part of a larger ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
The API program had three strategic goals:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow customers to automate document workflows without logging into the UI</li>
  <li>Enable internal Thomson Reuters products to integrate with GoFileRoom</li>
  <li>Create a foundation for new partner and ecosystem integrations</li>
</ul>

<p>
This made GoFileRoom more than a product — it made it a platform.
</p>

<h2>What I Owned</h2>
<p>
I was not writing production code. I was running the API business.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>API and webhook roadmap aligned to customer and revenue priorities</li>
  <li>REST and SOAP strategy, versioning, and endpoint governance</li>
  <li>Developer experience, documentation, and discoverability</li>
  <li>Internal and external API consumers and support models</li>
  <li>Usage telemetry, reliability, and commercial alignment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developer Experience & Documentation</h2>
<p>
When I took ownership, many APIs technically existed, but they were not usable.
Endpoints were listed as raw URIs with no descriptions, summaries, or guidance.
</p>

<p>
I led the migration to a modern developer portal and restructured how APIs were presented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Endpoints grouped into logical collections</li>
  <li>Human-readable summaries and descriptions added to every endpoint</li>
  <li>Use-case driven API catalogs instead of raw technical lists</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can see examples of the work here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/pages/api-catalog/6F89580F-E782-488C-A61F-E9C5FBC273BA#Overview" target="_blank">API Catalog — GoFileRoom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/pages/api-catalog/2758BAF0-BC6D-4CEE-869B-021ECEF06816#Overview" target="_blank">API Catalog — Integrations</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/pages/api-reference/75ea1657-e1a6-4c55-8752-3300ffeacd73" target="_blank">API Reference — Endpoints</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/pages/api-reference/6ec8c25b-924c-5a87-99b9-80e6b76e83aa" target="_blank">API Reference — Collections</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Every endpoint, summary, and structure on those pages was driven by my product strategy
for making the platform usable by real developers.
</p>

<h2>Webhooks & Workflow Automation</h2>
<p>
Beyond APIs, I led the delivery of webhook-based workflows that allowed firms
to react to document events in real time — removing manual polling and human intervention.
</p>

<p>
These capabilities were used by both external customers and internal Thomson Reuters teams
to build new services on top of GoFileRoom.
</p>

<h2>From Stickiness to Monetization</h2>
<p>
The APIs were initially included to drive platform stickiness and retention.
</p>

<p>
Using telemetry and dashboards I built, we could see which customers were making high volumes of API calls.
That data allowed us to create a premium usage tier for customers who needed higher throughput and deeper integrations.
</p>

<p>
APIs went from a cost center to a monetizable platform capability.
</p>

<h2>The Business Result</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Customers automated work that previously required multiple staff members</li>
  <li>Internal product teams unblocked their own roadmaps through GoFileRoom APIs</li>
  <li>Platform stickiness increased through deep integrations</li>
  <li>API usage became a lever for premium monetization</li>
</ul>

<p>
This API program was a key part of how GoFileRoom grew from $38M to over $43M in annual revenue
while rebuilding customer trust.
