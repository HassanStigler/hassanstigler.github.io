<h1>Product Leadership Beyond APIs</h1>
<div class="tagline">How I drove adoption, change, and value inside enterprise firms</div>

<p>
Before I led platforms and APIs, I led something harder:
people, workflows, and organizations that had to change how they worked.
</p>

<p>
As part of Thomson Reuters’ Professional Services and Training organizations,
I implemented GoFileRoom inside top-100 tax and accounting firms across the United States.
These were not greenfield SaaS startups — they were established, process-heavy organizations
with real risk, real deadlines, and little tolerance for disruption.
</p>

<h2>The Reality on the Ground</h2>
<p>
These firms didn’t fail because of bad software.
They struggled because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>People were attached to old processes</li>
  <li>Partners didn’t trust new workflows</li>
  <li>Staff feared losing productivity during change</li>
  <li>Leadership wanted ROI, not features</li>
</ul>

<p>
My job was to make the product work inside that reality.
</p>

<h2>What I Actually Did</h2>
<p>
I was not just training users. I was running product adoption as a business outcome.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mapped existing firm workflows and redesigned them around the software</li>
  <li>Identified friction points that blocked adoption and escalated them into product changes</li>
  <li>Led in-person and virtual change management for staff, managers, and partners</li>
  <li>Translated product features into financial and operational value for firm leadership</li>
  <li>Worked with engineering and product teams to close gaps that blocked real-world use</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Result</h2>
<p>
These firms didn’t just install software — they changed how they worked.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document workflows that once took days were reduced to minutes</li>
  <li>Firms saved 30+ hours per week through process and software optimization</li>
  <li>Adoption increased because the product fit how people actually worked</li>
</ul>

<p>
This experience shaped how I later ran GoFileRoom as a Product Manager:
I never treated roadmaps as technical plans — I treated them as change plans.
</p>

<h2>How This Informed My Product Leadership</h2>
<p>
When I later owned the GoFileRoom roadmap, I brought this mindset with me:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Features must solve real workflow problems, not just technical ones</li>
  <li>Roadmaps must be credible to customers, not just engineering</li>
  <li>Adoption and trust matter as much as delivery</li>
  <li>Every product decision creates organizational change for someone</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is how I was able to rebuild customer trust, raise pNPS,
and grow GoFileRoom from $38M to $43M as a Product Manager.
</p>

<h2>What This Means for You</h2>
<p>
Whether I am working on APIs, platforms, or traditional SaaS products,
I lead with the same principle:
</p>

<p>
<strong>Products succeed when people can actually use them — and trust that they are going somewhere.</strong>
</p>

<p>
That is how I run roadmaps, teams, and platforms.
